# Branching Introduction

:"
>>>> The Master Branch
        In git, we are always working on a branch*
        The default branch name is master.
        It doesn't do anything special or have fancy powers. It's just like any other branch.

        Many people designate the master branch as their 'source of truth' or the 'official branch' for their codebase, but that is left to you to decide.
